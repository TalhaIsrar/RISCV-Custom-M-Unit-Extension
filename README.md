# RISC-V M Extension Co-Processor

Custom Implementation of Multiplication and Division Instructions

## Overview

This project implements the **M extension** of the RISC-V instruction set as a **co-processor** designed to handle multiplication and division operations. The design splits the implementation into two distinct components: a **control path** and a **data path**, each fulfilling a dedicated role in executing the arithmetic instructions.

## Architecture

### Signal Interface Description

| Signal   | Direction | Width   | Description                                                                                                                                               |
|----------|-----------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `valid`  | Input     | 1 bit   | Set by the processor when an unknown instruction is discovered. `insn`, `rs1`, and `rs2` are assigned at the same time.                                  |
| `insn`   | Input     | 32 bits | Holds the unknown instruction; assigned simultaneously with `valid`.                                                                                      |
| `rs1`    | Input     | 32 bits | Holds the value of register `rs1` from the instruction `insn`.                                                                                            |
| `rs2`    | Input     | 32 bits | Holds the value of register `rs2` from the instruction `insn`.                                                                                            |
| `ready`  | Output    | 1 bit   | Set by the co-processor to signal that instruction execution is complete and outputs are ready. High for **only one clock cycle**, otherwise causes error. |
| `wr`     | Output    | 1 bit   | Set by the co-processor simultaneously with `ready` if the instruction has a result to return.                                                           |
| `rd`     | Output    | 32 bits | Holds the result value when `wr` is set.                                                                                                                  |
| `busy`   | Output    | 1 bit   | Indicates instruction is being processed. If neither `ready` nor `busy` is high within 16 cycles of `valid`, the processor treats it as illegal.         |


### üîß Control Path

The control path is governed by a finite state machine (FSM) with the following states:

* **IDLE**: Waits for the activation signal from the main core.
* **MULTIPLY**: Performs multiplication based on multiplication type.
* **DIVIDE**: Performs division in multiple cycles based on bitwise divison algorithm.
* **SELECT**: Select the correct register to put into output.
* **DONE**: Signals the main core the completion of the multiplication/division.

### üßÆ Data Path

The data path consists of:

* A **register file** for holding operands and results.
* An **ALU** for performing arithmetic operations.
* A control signal `sub_reg` from the ALU to the register file to manage operand routing.

### 32-Bit Signed/Unsigned Division Algorithm
The code uses an optimized version of the algorithm presented below:

**Inputs:**
- `A`, `B`: 32-bit signed/unsigned integers
- `FUNC3`: 3-bit control signal (determines `DIV` or `REM` operation)

**Outputs:**
- `Z`: Quotient (32-bit signed/unsigned integer)
- `R`: Remainder (32-bit signed/unsigned integer)

The algorithm ensures:  
> **A = Z √ó B + R**

---

```pseudocode
begin
    if (FUNC3 == DIV or FUNC3 == REM) then
        signA ‚Üê A[31]
        signB ‚Üê B[31]

        if (signA) then
            A ‚Üê ~A + 1     // Convert to absolute value
        end if

        if (signB) then
            B ‚Üê ~B + 1     // Convert to absolute value
        end if
    end if

    R ‚Üê A
    B ‚Üê {0, B, ZERO_31}    // Left shift B by 31 bits (align divisor)
    Z ‚Üê 0

    for i = 0 to 31 do
        Z ‚Üê Z << 1
        if (R - B ‚â• 0) then
            Z ‚Üê Z + 1
            R ‚Üê R - B
        end if
        B ‚Üê B >> 1
    end for

    if (FUNC3 == DIV or FUNC3 == REM) then
        if (signA XOR signB) then
            Z ‚Üê ~Z + 1     // Apply sign to quotient
        end if
        if (signA) then
            R ‚Üê ~R + 1     // Apply sign to remainder
        end if
    end if

    return Z, R
end

```

## Testbenches

Two testbenches were developed for this project:

1. **Register File Testbench**

   * Tests various multiplexer combinations.
   * Verifies correct register write and read operations.

2. **Co-Processor Testbench**

   * **Multiplication Tests**:

     * Positive √ó Positive
     * Negative √ó Positive
     * Maximum possible values (overflow scenarios)
   * **Division & Remainder Tests**:

     * Positive √∑ Positive
     * Negative √∑ Positive
     * Division by zero
     * Dividend < Divisor (Quotient = 0, Remainder = Dividend)
     * Division of minimum negative number by -1 (overflow)
